# Getting Started with Cool App

This guide will help you set up and run your app.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment file and add your keys
cp .env.example .env

# Start the development server

## Environment Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values:

### Local Storage

Your app uses local AsyncStorage for data persistence.
No cloud configuration is required.

> **Note:** Data is stored on-device only. Users cannot sync
> across devices, and data is lost when the app is uninstalled.

### AI Chat Configuration

Your app includes the Chat feature with AI integration.

> **⚠️ Security Warning:** API keys are exposed client-side in
> React Native apps. For production, implement a backend proxy
> to keep your keys secure.

Get API keys for your selected providers:

- **OpenAI**: [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

Add the keys to your `.env` file:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```
